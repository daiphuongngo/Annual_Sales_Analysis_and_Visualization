##1/ What was the best month for Sales? How much was earned on that month?

##2/ Which city had the best Sales of the year?

##3/ When was the most efficient time to display ads to maximize/optimize the possibility of customers' decisions to buy products?

##4/ Which products were most sold together?

##5/ Which product was sold the most? Why do you think it was the best-selling product?
